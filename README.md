# Decimal to Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Converter

This is a simple x86 assembly language program that converts a decimal number input by the user into its binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations. It utilizes Irvine32 library for input and output operations.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Assemble the source code using an assembler compatible with the Irvine32 library (e.g., MASM).
3. Run the compiled executable.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a decimal number.
2. It reads the input decimal number.
3. It then converts the decimal number into binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations.
4. Finally, it displays the converted values for each base.
